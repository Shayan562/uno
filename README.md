# Uno Card Game

This project is the implementation of the uno card game using Python. It will be an online multiplayer game.  
For now it will have a clean and simple gui featuring only the classic game mode(classic rules); it will have only one room i.e. one live game at a time.  
In the future, the plan is to have multiple rooms with the ability to modifiy the setting of each room. The inclusion of other game modes and the option to create custom game modes will be added in the future.
