# Uno Card Game

This project is the implementation of the uno card game using Python. It will be online multiplayer game.  
For now it will have a clean and simple gui featuring only the classic game mode; it will only have one room i.e. one live game only.  
In the future, the plan is to have multiple rooms with the ability to modifiy the setting of each room. The inclusion of other game modes and the option to create custom game modes will be added in the future.
